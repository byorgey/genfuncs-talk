*Combinatorial structures* such as lists, trees, graphs, and
permutations show up all over the place---in computer science and
math, but also in physics, chemistry, biology, and many other areas.
In this talk, I will explain a systematic way to describe and classify
such combinatorial structures, with surprising and beautiful
connections to certain types of infinite polynomials known as
*generating functions*.  I will then show how we can generalize these
polynomials over arbitrary *semirings* in order to compute answers to
questions of interest about combinatorial structures.  Everything will
be explained starting from first principles---no particular background
in combinatorics or algebra will be necessary to follow the talk.
